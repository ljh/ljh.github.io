	<p><strong>Student Impact</strong></p>
<p>While we can get some idea of impact based on costs of previous textbooks, we'd like your observations and opinions about how your use of OER impacted your students:</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you explain the Creative Commons and / or OER to your students?</li>
<li>Did your students express an opinion about the use of OER in your class?</li>
<li>Do you feel that your use of OER affected student achievement in the class - either positively or negatively?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Teaching Practice</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Do you feel that using OER has provided you with more or less flexibility in terms of your choice of course materials? Alternatively, do you feel you had about the same degree of flexibility you would have with customary textbooks or course materials?</li>
<li>Has this experience changed your opinion about using OER in the classroom?</li>
<li>Do you think you will continue to use OER in this class? Will you try to use OER in other classes you teach?</li>
<li>Has this experience affected your teaching philosophy in any way?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Networking</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Did you think your use of OER in the classroom has influenced anyone else in your department?</li>
<li>Did your involvement with this OER initiative provide you with opportunities to meet and network with people outside of your department, or outside of Oswego?</li>

<p>On a totally different note, I've been thinking about tracking my period and my overall pain because there is a lot of different stuff going on. I think it would be good to have a yearly tracker if possible, but I'm not sure that it is possible. My thought is, though, that I want to see if there are patterns from month to month. I guess another alternative would be to do it weekly. Which reminds me to stop and consider: why am I not doing habit tracking weekly? Um, here's one reason: it would be a long list. On the other hand, almost everything I need would be in one spread. Anyway, I want to brainstorm a bit about things I might want to track. Irritability is one thing. That definitely goes along with both my period and pain. Maybe feeling overstimulated. The location of my headache. Weather? I'm pretty sure weather isn't a trigger for me, but hey. What I took medicine wise, how much, how I felt, say, 2 hours after taking it. For periods: color (brown vs. red), heaviness (light, medium, heavy), mucusy or not. Back to headaches: stretches. Also water intake. Okay, so what about pelvic pain. Whether they're associated with digestive issues. All my pelvic pain seems to be in the same location. How can I differentiate? I guess by tracking IC symptoms. Like, say, urgency (feeling of needing to go), frequency (how much I'm going...though this has never really been an issue). I guess flare vs. cramp. That's one way to differentiate the pain.</p>
<p>So, I'm thinking maybe a monthly or yearly chart for tracking whether I experience bleeding, pelvic pain, and headache. Then, maybe something more detailed for tracking symptoms and triggers and treatment and so forth? Maybe dots, outlines, fill in, for each? That way I could do all of them in one square.</p>

So we pay about $450 for Library H3lp, and about $240 for Gimlet. Do we use anything else at the desk, or for the desk? Email is free, so there's not that. Basically, we need $1600 in value out of LibAnswers. Stuff that the others can't provide. Here are some things I am thinking of: 
- FAQ tool, including what people are searching for
- READ scale in Ref. Analytics
- feedback and ideas manager
- point of need help in databases / catalog etc.
- systems status 
- chat is better. ratings. can have different departments set up too. transcripts available for users, not just us. for us, they're easier to access. 
- not sure if the social thing would be of interest, ask Sharona. No Insta, which is a bummer. 
(I think that Juan would be most interested in the latter two.)

		<blockquote>
			<p>I disagree with the "what is the most important thing" approach. I think it's too simplistic.</p>
			<p>I think it's best to go in this order:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What, if I don't do it at all, will have absolutely no ramifications whatsoever?</li>
				<li>What, if I don't do it this week, will have no ramifications for me this semester?</li>
				<li>What, if I don't do it today, will have no ramifications for me this week?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Then, when you know what you're not going to do (make the list smaller), ask:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>What is the most critical thing for me to do this week?</li>
				<li>What is the most critical thing for to prepare me for next month?</li>
				<li>What is the most critical thing to prepare me for next year?</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Then you sort the list and make sure you do at least one "this week" task per day, one "next month" task per week, and one "next year" task per month.</p>
			<p>It's not a perfect system, but giving yourself permission to drop shit and leave it dropped is one of the biggest and most powerful pieces of time management that no one talks about.</p>

		<p>Notes from OER webinar</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Can we start reaching out to the high enrollment gened courses now, for the spring semester?</li>
			<li>OER costs (vendors) would be covered by SUNY in year 1 including SUNY OER services</li>
			<li>we really need a sustainability model - students charged lab fees to help cover costs (lumen, etc., ID, librarians, etc.)</li>
			<li>What KIND of support do they (faculty?) need?</li>
			<li>What does our partnership with openstax mean?</li>
			<li>Mark says they're planning to have prof dev stuff ready by Oct. 15 of this year - good way to network in discipline</li>
			<li>high enrollment is specific to the program, not the campus</li>

		<p>The goal of content strategy is to create meaningful, cohesive, engaging, and sustainable content. Throughout her book, Content Strategy for the Web, Kristina Halvorson discusses in detail the benefits of and how to create your content strategy. It reiterates that your strategy helps you to identify what already exists, what should be created and, more importantly, why it should be created.

		<p>Reflections from last night's SPE 504 class:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Students preferred Kahoot over Socrative - as did I. The teacher interface was very confusing and hard to remember.</li>
			<li>When I chose a citation to work with, I picked one from 2017. This was not an effective example for showing the "look forward" part of citation hunting.</li>
			<li>It may be useful to show students how to change their library link settings in Google Scholar.</li>
			<li>It may be a good idea for me to discuss interlibrary loan in future sessions.</li>
			<li>When teaching in that room (107), recall that the computer setup is terrible. I was blocking the left side of the screen.</li>
			<li>Try explaining the citation management part in more detail. It seemed awkwardly shoe-horned in when I was talking about it last night.</li>
			<li>I may want to start bringing bottles of water to my classes, since I sweat a lot.</li>
